## nëstlink

A LÖVE Potion networked game debugger. Code based off/using parts of [lovebird](https://github.com/rxi/lovebird).
This tool was made to work similarly to how `nxlink` handles redirected stdout/stderr calls for Nintendo Switch homebrew.

See the [relevant Wiki page for more information](https://lovebrew.org/#/nestlink).
